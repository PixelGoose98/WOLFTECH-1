# WOLFTECH-1
(v0.0.1) a raycaster game engine with basic shooting , textures and sprites a crosshair, a map editor all inspired by wolfenstein3d

# USAGE
  unfortunatelly most of the code is crammed into main.cpp, sorry about that but next version im splitting the files,
  for now the game only loads map.h no other maps its hard coded. to make or edit a map, you can use the map editor

  if you read the code you can see how textures are added and controlls and if you read the map.h you can see how it works.

  again there isnt really a propper documentation FOR NOW. i will be fixing that soon.

  REMEMBER, whenever you make a new map.h, you need to re compile the main.cpp.

# COMPILATION
  THIS REQUIRES SDL 1.2, i know its old as shit but.... fuck you.

  just run the makefiles for the game and the map editor

  make and then make run.
